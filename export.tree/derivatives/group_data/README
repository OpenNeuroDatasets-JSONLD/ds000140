This directory contains data that relates to the second-level analyses that were included 
in the paper (Woo et al., 2015, Plos Biol). The following is a quote from the paper:

"Second-level analyses (group) were conducted using robust regression [99] with cognitive 
regulation strength (mean difference between pain ratings for regulate-up versus regulate 
down for each temperature level) or pain sensitivity (mean pain rating across passive 
experience trials) as second-level covariates for regressors for cognitive regulation and 
stimulus intensity, respectively. All results were thresholded at p,0.05, FWER corrected 
based on cluster extent with primary threshold of p,0.001, p,0.0005, or p,0.00001, 
two-tailed. The cluster extents for FWER correction were estimated based on Monte Carlo 
simulation (10,000 iterations) with 3dClustSim of AFNI (http://afni.nimh.nih.gov/) using 
the estimated intrinsic smoothness [100] using 3dFWHMx of AFNI. For the purpose of display, 
we pruned the results using two additional higher levels of voxel-wise threshold."
